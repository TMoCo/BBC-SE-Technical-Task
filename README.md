# BBC Software Engineering Graduate Scheme Technical Task

## Overview
The given task is to make a program that plays Blackjack, to get a hand that is as close to 21 as possible. The basic scenatio is quite straightforward: simulate a deck of 52 cards and draw cards to get as close to 21 as possible.

## Design Decisions
I have chosen C++ as this is the language I am the most comfortable in and allows me to add graphics to the application.
My initial solution will consist of a simple GUI with options to either Hit or Stand based on the player's current hand. This solution will also feature basic AI oponents that have the same set of options available. Players will be able to start new games at the click of a button.

A future version will allow for multiple hands with the option to split and a dealer with a hand to beat. Adding rule variations such as hole hards are also desirable.

## Screnshots of development:
First working application, featuring a text log displaying game events and scores, gui buttons to hit or stand, and very greedy AI players (they always hit).
